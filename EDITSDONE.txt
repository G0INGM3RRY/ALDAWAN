````````````````````DEVELOPMENT SERVER SETUP```````````````````````````````````````````````

LOCAL DEVELOPMENT (Computer Only):
- Start Laragon
- php artisan serve
- npm run dev
- Access: http://localhost:8000 or http://127.0.0.1:8000

MOBILE ACCESS (Phone on Same Network):
1. Find your computer's IP address:
   Windows: ipconfig (look for IPv4 Address)
   Mac/Linux: ifconfig or ip addr show
   
2. Start Laravel with your IP address:
   php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
   OR
   php artisan serve --host=YOUR_IP_ADDRESS --port=8000
   
3. Start Vite with network access:
   npm run dev -- --host=0.0.0.0
   OR
   npm run dev -- --host=YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
   
4. Access from phone:
   http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8000
   
Example:
- If your computer IP is 192.168.1.100
- Commands: 
  php artisan serve --host=192.168.1.100 --port=8000
  npm run dev -- --host=192.168.1.100
- Phone URL: http://192.168.1.100:8000

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Both devices must be on same WiFi network
- Disable firewall or allow ports 8000 and 5173
- Use actual IP address, not localhost/127.0.0.1
- Keep both terminals running (artisan serve + npm run dev)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Order
Model + Migration first: you lock the schema, so everything else stops drifting.

Routes next: sets the contract (URLs & verbs) early.

Controller next: glue logic with clear inputs/outputs.

Views last: UI builds on stable data and endpoints. Less rework

      SAFE GIT PUSH STEPS (IRREVERSIBLE - USE WITH CAUTION):
      1. git add .                     # Stage all changes
      2. git commit -m "Complete job management CRUD system"  # Commit with message
      3. git push origin main          # Push to GitHub main branch
      
      ALTERNATIVE SAFER APPROACH:
      1. git add .
      2. git commit -m "Complete job management CRUD system"
      3. git push origin main          # Creates backup on GitHub
      4. If needed later: git revert HEAD~1  # Undo last commit (safer than force push)
      
      NUCLEAR OPTION (IRREVERSIBLE - DESTROYS HISTORY):
      git push --force origin main     # DANGER: Overwrites remote history permanently

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**JOBSEEKER PROFILE UPDATE SYSTEM - COMPREHENSIVE BUG FIXES**
**Date:** September 23, 2025
**Issue:** Skills, disabilities, and educational levels not storing properly in jobseeker profiles

= **PROBLEM DIAGNOSIS**
  **Initial Issues Reported:**
  • edit/update navigation didn't work for informal jobseekers
  • "Undefined variable $disabilities" errors in view templates
  • Skills and disabilities not saving to database during profile updates
  • Educational levels not storing in respective columns
  • Form submissions appearing successful but data not persisting

= **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**
  **Multiple Systemic Issues Discovered:**
  1. Navigation routing problems preventing informal users from accessing edit forms
  2. Controller methods missing required view variables (skills, disabilities, educationLevels)
  3. Database schema mismatch - controller using old JSON columns that no longer exist
  4. Eloquent relationship methods not being recognized due to model file corruption
  5. Incorrect eager loading syntax in controller methods
  6. Form data transmission working correctly, but backend processing failing

= **COMPREHENSIVE FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

  **1. Navigation System Repair**
    **File:** `resources/views/layouts/dashboard.blade.php`
    **Fix:** Updated sidebar navigation with proper conditional routing logic
    **Changes:**
    • Added conditional check for informal vs formal jobseeker types
    • Fixed route generation to use appropriate edit methods for each user type
    • Informal users: route('jobseekers.informal.edit')
    • Formal users: route('jobseekers.edit')

  **2. Controller Variable Loading**
    **File:** `app/Http/Controllers/JobseekerProfileController.php`
    **Methods Updated:**
    • `edit()` - Added missing skills, disabilities, educationLevels variables
    • `editInformal()` - Added missing disabilities, informalSkills variables
    **Impact:** Eliminated "Undefined variable" errors in view templates

  **3. Database Schema Modernization**
    **Issue:** Controller attempting to save to non-existent JSON columns
    **Old Approach:** `$profile->skills = json_encode($skills)`
    **New Approach:** Direct pivot table operations using raw DB queries
    **Tables Used:**
    • `jobseeker_skills` (pivot table for skills relationship)
    • `jobseeker_disabilities` (pivot table for disabilities relationship)
    • `jobseeker_profiles` (education fields: education_level_id, institution_name, graduation_year, gpa, degree_field)

  **4. Education Field Handling Update**
    **Changes Made:**
    • Removed 'education' from excluded relationship fields in update methods
    • Added explicit handling for education_level_id (foreign key)
    • Added processing for direct education columns: institution_name, graduation_year, gpa, degree_field
    • Updated validation rules to accept new field structure

  **5. Relationship Processing Implementation**
    **Skills Processing:**
    ```php
    // Delete existing relationships
    DB::table('jobseeker_skills')->where('jobseeker_profile_id', $profile->id)->delete();
    
    // Insert new relationships
    foreach ($skillIds as $skillId) {
        $skillData[] = [
            'jobseeker_profile_id' => $profile->id,
            'skill_id' => $skillId,
            'proficiency_level' => null,
            'years_experience' => null,
            'created_at' => now(),
            'updated_at' => now()
        ];
    }
    DB::table('jobseeker_skills')->insert($skillData);
    ```

    **Disabilities Processing:**
    ```php
    // Delete existing relationships  
    DB::table('jobseeker_disabilities')->where('jobseeker_profile_id', $profile->id)->delete();
    
    // Insert new relationships
    foreach ($disabilityIds as $disabilityId) {
        $disabilityData[] = [
            'jobseeker_profile_id' => $profile->id,
            'disability_id' => $disabilityId,
            'accommodation_needs' => null,
            'created_at' => now(),
            'updated_at' => now()
        ];
    }
    DB::table('jobseeker_disabilities')->insert($disabilityData);
    ```

  **6. Model File Recovery and Restoration**
    **Critical Issue:** JobseekerProfile model became corrupted/truncated
    **Problem:** Model file reduced to 33 lines, missing all relationship methods
    **Impact:** "Call to undefined relationship [skills]" errors
    
    **Complete Model Restoration:**
    **File:** `app/Models/JobseekerProfile.php` (fully recreated)
    **Added Missing Elements:**
    • Proper namespace imports (BelongsTo, BelongsToMany, HasMany)
    • Updated fillable array with normalized fields (removed old JSON columns)
    • All relationship method definitions:
      - skills(): BelongsToMany with jobseeker_skills pivot
      - disabilities(): BelongsToMany with jobseeker_disabilities pivot  
      - educationLevel(): BelongsTo relationship
      - user(), workExperiences(), jobApplications(), jobPreferences()
    • Proper method signatures with return types
    • Scope methods (scopeFormal, scopeInformal)

  **7. Eager Loading Syntax Correction**
    **Problem:** Incorrect relationship loading syntax
    **Old (Incorrect):** `$user->jobseekerProfile()->with(['skills', 'disabilities'])->first()`
    **New (Correct):** `JobseekerProfile::with(['skills', 'disabilities'])->where('user_id', $user->id)->first()`
    
    **Files Updated:**
    • `edit()` method - eager loads skills, disabilities, educationLevel
    • `editInformal()` method - eager loads skills, disabilities

  **Solution Implemented:** Smart skills limit system with automatic rotation and usage-based prioritization

= **CORE FEATURES IMPLEMENTED**

  **1. Limited Skills Display (20 Skills Maximum)**
    • Each category (formal/informal) displays maximum 20 skills in forms
    • Dynamic selection shows most relevant skills based on usage and popularity  
    • Automatic rotation when new skills added - less popular custom skills get hidden
    • Built-in skills always prioritized and never hidden

  **2. Usage-Based Skill Prioritization**
    • Added usage_count field to track skill popularity across all users
    • Smart ordering algorithm: Built-in skills → High usage → Recent creation
    • Popular custom skills become permanent additions to the display list
    • Unpopular custom skills automatically rotate out when limit exceeded

  **3. Custom Skills Management System**
    • Automatic creation of custom skills when users type new ones
    • Duplicate prevention - checks existing skills before creating new entries
    • Smart categorization - formal skills → technical category, informal → trade category
    • Usage increment when skills selected to boost popularity

= **DATABASE SCHEMA ENHANCEMENTS**

  **Migration Created:** 2025_10_02_151857_add_usage_tracking_to_skills_table.php

    • usage_count (integer, default 0) - tracks popularity
    • is_custom (boolean, default false) - distinguishes user-created vs built-in skills  
    • show_in_list (boolean, default true) - controls display visibility
    • last_used_at (timestamp, nullable) - tracks recent usage for analytics
    • Database indexes added for performance optimization

  **Data Initialization:**
    • All existing skills marked as built-in (is_custom = false)
    • Base usage count of 1 assigned to existing skills
    • All existing skills set to show_in_list = true

= **MODEL ENHANCEMENTS (app/Models/Skill.php)**

  **New Methods Added:**
    • getLimitedSkillsForDisplay($category, $limit = 20) - Returns top 20 skills per category
    • createOrGetCustomSkill($name, $category) - Smart custom skill creation with limit management
    • incrementUsage() - Updates usage statistics when skills are selected
    • manageDisplayLimit($category, $limit = 20) - Automatically hides excess custom skills
    • displayable() scope - Gets skills that should show in lists

  **Category Mapping Logic:**
    • Formal skills → ['technical', 'soft', 'language'] categories
    • Informal skills → ['trade', 'soft'] categories
    • Maintains backward compatibility with existing category system

= **CONTROLLER UPDATES**

  **JobseekerProfileController.php Updates:**
    • store() method - Updated formal skills handling to use new system
