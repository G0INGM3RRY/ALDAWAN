needs to be done: 

MESSAGING feature
ADMIN DASHBOARDS 
REPORT GENERATIONS
1. fixing on console issues and errors 

3. on Employer's Database there are fields but werent field in edit, register, and update

7. i still havent grasped how the skills table accomodate formal and informal even though skills in each entity means differently,

8. still havent figured out what happens after user is accepted or rejected. 

9. the rating portion on the informal side. more of stars for seeker's trueness.

10. also i think in the job listing and application flow, after the employer accepted an application, 
        he can still let the application open to accomodate if number of vacancy they have is more than one

13. i found that formal jobseeker can see informal jobs when browse jobs is clicked. 

14. photo on the form, it displays the recent on the db, i want it to be real time. also, when signing up, the complete.blade throws $profile as undefined,
        then when refreshed account is created, without name or anything.

15. in users table theres verified/unverified column, what ways to be a user is verified at the state of my project.

16. I also added religion field on informal edit.blade, did the other disabilities field on formal and informal but no backend support yet. in the very,
        basic way can it when user input then clicked ok the input automatically listed but the form still remains in the current phase.

17. Work Experience section removed - using structured work_experiences instead, now i want it back but must be patterned from the migrations 

18. The fields in the complete.blade that are required, make a mark to signify it. also it causes inappropriate in the flow of my sectioning of form
        as it doesnt tell why the complete profile button isnt working. and i can only know because  i made some fields required.

CURRENT DATABASE STATUS (33 migrations total):
✅ Core structure is EXCELLENT and ready for ERD/Data Dictionary
✅ Proper normalization with foreign keys and indexes
✅ Both formal and informal job workflows supported

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

1. INFORMAL JOB APPLICATIONS:
   - Currently uses SAME table: 'formal_job_applications' for both types
   - Differentiated by job_listings.job_type enum ('formal'/'informal')
   - JobApplication model handles both with same fields
   - Works but not optimized for different workflows

2. JOB CATEGORIES SYSTEM:
   - classifications table (IT, Healthcare, Education, etc.)
   - job_classifications pivot table (many-to-many)
   - job_listings.job_type enum (formal/informal)
   - employment_type enum (full_time, part_time, contract, etc.)
   - Some redundancy between 'classification' string field vs normalized classifications table

3. APPLICATION DOCUMENTS STORAGE:
   - resume_file_path: single file string
   - additional_documents: JSON array of file paths
   - Files stored in storage/app/public/
   - Supports: PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG (max 2MB each)
   - View/download functionality working

FUTURE OPTIMIZATIONS TO CONSIDER:

A) CREATE SEPARATE INFORMAL APPLICATIONS TABLE:
   - informal_job_applications table with simplified fields
   - Different workflow: contact info + optional portfolio
   - Status: interested, contacted, hired, declined
   - Simpler than formal application process

B) NORMALIZE DOCUMENT STORAGE:
   - application_documents table instead of JSON
   - Better file management and tracking
   - document_type, file_path, uploaded_at, file_size

C) UNIFIED CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM:
   - Remove redundant 'classification' string field
   - Use only normalized classifications table
   - Add job_category table if needed (different from classifications)

D) MISSING TABLES TO ADD:
   - job_bookmarks (save job feature)
   - employer_ratings (for informal workers)
   - application_interview_schedules
   - job_application_status_history

CURRENT PRIORITY: Database structure is 95% ready for ERD creation.
Focus on fixing critical bugs first, optimize structure later.

 E. error on employer functionalities

 F. Breadcrumbing
