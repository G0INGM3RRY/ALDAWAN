needs to be done: 

MESSAGING feature
ADMIN DASHBOARDS 
REPORT GENERATIONS


1. Employer - In the job creation, add another field, for disability it might avoid of.  
    (example Driving [disability isnt allowed, visual disability, hearing])
    this require update onthe joblisting column

2. Errors on employer navigations on Job posting

3. on Employer's Database there are fields but werent field in edit, register, and update

4. portioning the complete profile form and locking the email used in user table to the complete db


7. i still havent grasped how the skills table accomodate formal and informal even though skills in each entity means differently,

8. still havent figured out what happens after user is accepted or rejected. 

9. the rating portion on the informal side. more of stars for seeker's trueness.

10. also i think in the job listing and application flow, after the employer accepted an application, 
        he can still let the application open to accomodate if number of vacancy they have is more than one

11. I made sex field to radio with bugs that it can select 2 of them at once

13. i found that formal jobseeker can see informal jobs when browse jobs is clicked. 

14. photo on the form, it displays the recent on the db, i want it to be real time. also, when signing up, the complete.blade throws $profile as undefined,
        then when refreshed account is created, without name or anything.

15. in users table theres verified/unverified column, what ways to be a user is verified at the state of my project.

16. I also added religion field on informal edit.blade, did the other disabilities field on formal and informal but no backend support yet. in the very,
        basic way can it when user input then clicked ok the input automatically listed but the form still remains in the current phase.

17. Work Experience section removed - using structured work_experiences instead, now i want it back but must be patterned from the migrations
